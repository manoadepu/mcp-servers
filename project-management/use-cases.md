# Project Management Use Cases

## Overview
This document outlines real-world use cases for different roles in software development teams and how our Project Management Assistant helps streamline their workflows through natural language interactions. Instead of switching between multiple tools and dashboards, team members can simply express their needs in natural language and get comprehensive insights and actions.

## Role-Based Scenarios

### Technical Project Manager (TPM)

#### Common Challenges
- Managing cross-team dependencies
- Resource planning and allocation
- Technical debt tracking
- Roadmap planning
- Risk management

#### Scenario 1: Dependency Management
```
TPM: "Show me all cross-team dependencies for the authentication service"
Assistant: "Analyzing dependencies...
- Auth API team waiting on Security team's encryption service
- Frontend team blocked on Auth API endpoints
- DevOps needs security audit completion
Recommendation: Schedule sync meeting with Security team as they're the critical path.
Would you like me to:
1. Create a dependency tracking ticket
2. Schedule a sync meeting
3. Generate a detailed dependency report?"
```

#### Scenario 2: Resource Planning
```
TPM: "Do we have enough backend capacity for next quarter's roadmap?"
Assistant: "Analyzing resource needs vs capacity:
- 3 senior backend devs available
- 5 major backend features planned
- 2 devs have overlapping PTO in March
Risk: Backend capacity at 120% for Q2
Suggestions:
1. Move Feature X to Q3 (lowest priority)
2. Add contractor support (estimated cost: $X)
3. Split Feature Y into smaller phases
Would you like me to model different scenarios?"
```

#### Scenario 3: Technical Debt Management
```
TPM: "What's our technical debt status across services?"
Assistant: "Technical debt analysis:
High Impact Areas:
- Payment Service: 45% test coverage (down 15%)
- User Service: 3 critical dependencies need updates
- API Gateway: Performance degrading 5% monthly

Recommendations:
1. Allocate 20% of next sprint to payment service tests
2. Schedule dependency updates during low-traffic period
3. Initiate API Gateway optimization project

Generated detailed report with metrics and trends.
Would you like me to create JIRA tickets for these items?"
```

### Scrum Master

#### Common Challenges
- Sprint health monitoring
- Team velocity tracking
- Impediment resolution
- Retrospective management
- Process improvement

#### Scenario 1: Sprint Health Monitoring
```
SM: "Are we on track for sprint completion?"
Assistant: "Sprint health analysis:
- 65% of story points completed (ahead by 10%)
- 2 stories blocked by external dependencies
- Team velocity trending up 15%
- No major blockers in daily standups

Opportunities:
1. Can pull in 2 stories from backlog (13 points capacity)
2. One team member available to help with blocked stories

Would you like me to update the sprint board?"
```

#### Scenario 2: Team Performance Analytics
```
SM: "How is team productivity trending?"
Assistant: "Team metrics for last 3 sprints:
- Velocity: 45 → 52 → 48 points
- Cycle Time: Improved 25%
- PR Review Time: Increased by 1 day
- Story Point Accuracy: 85% (up from 70%)

Key Insights:
1. PR reviews becoming a bottleneck
2. Story point estimation improving
3. Cycle time improvements saving 2 days per feature

Would you like a detailed report for the retrospective?"
```

#### Scenario 3: Retrospective Insights
```
SM: "Summarize key themes from our retrospectives"
Assistant: "Analyzing last 3 retros:
Recurring Themes:
1. Communication gaps with external teams
2. Test environment stability issues
3. Positive feedback on pair programming

Progress:
- 80% of previous retro actions completed
- Test environment uptime improved 30%
- Cross-team sync meetings established

Would you like me to prepare a trends presentation for the team?"
```

### Project Manager

#### Common Challenges
- Timeline & milestone tracking
- Budget management
- Resource allocation
- Stakeholder communication
- Risk mitigation

#### Scenario 1: Timeline & Milestone Tracking
```
PM: "Will we hit our Q2 deliverables?"
Assistant: "Q2 milestone analysis:
On Track:
- User Authentication (85% complete)
- API Gateway Migration (ahead by 2 weeks)

At Risk:
- Payment Integration (blocked by vendor)
- Performance Optimization (resource constraint)

Critical Path Analysis:
1. Vendor dependency blocking 3 downstream features
2. Resource bottleneck affecting 2 major deliverables

Would you like me to generate a risk mitigation plan?"
```

#### Scenario 2: Budget & Resource Allocation
```
PM: "Show our resource utilization and budget status"
Assistant: "Current allocation:
Budget: 75% used (on track)
Resources:
- Frontend: 100% utilized
- Backend: 85% utilized
- QA: 120% over-allocated

Alerts:
1. QA team needs support for upcoming UAT
2. Contractor budget has 20% buffer
3. Training budget underutilized

Would you like me to model resource reallocation options?"
```

#### Scenario 3: Stakeholder Updates
```
PM: "Generate status update for stakeholders"
Assistant: "Compiling key metrics and updates:
Project Health:
- 15% ahead of schedule
- All critical paths staffed
- 3 risks mitigated last week
- Customer feedback positive (NPS +10)

Key Achievements:
1. Authentication service launched
2. Performance improved 25%
3. Customer adoption exceeding targets

Generated detailed report with charts in stakeholder format.
Would you like me to schedule the update meeting?"
```

### Developer

#### Common Challenges

   - Matches your recent auth work
   - Blocking frontend team
   - Estimated: 3 story points

2. JIRA-456: Performance Optimization
   - Uses your Redis expertise
   - Non-blocking but high value
   - Estimated: 5 story points
